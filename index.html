        <h1>40 maps that explain the internet</h1>
        <span class="tim">by <a href="">Timothy B. Lee</a> on June 2, 2014</span>
        <p>The internet increasingly pervades our lives, delivering information to us no matter where we are. It takes a complex system of cables, servers, towers, and other infrastructure, developed over decades, to allow us to stay in touch with our friends and family so effortlessly. Here are 40 maps that will help you better understand the internet — where it came from, how it works, and how it's used by people around the world.</p>

              <h3>Before the internet, there was the ARPANET</h3>
              <p>
                ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet, was an academic
                research project funded by the Advanced Research Projects
                Agency, a branch of the military known for funding ambitious
                research projects without immediate commercial or military
                applications. Initially, the network only connected the
                University of Utah with three research centers in California.
                ARPANET was a test of a then-novel technology called
                packet-switching, which breaks data into small "packets" so they
                can be transmitted efficiently across the network. It also had a
                more practical goal: allowing more efficient use of expensive
                computing resources. Computer scientists sometimes used ARPA
                money to buy computers, and the agency hoped that ARPANET would
                allow universities to share these expensive resources more
                efficiently. One of the first ARPANET applications was Telnet,
                which allowed a researcher at one ARPANET site to log into a
                computer at another site.

              <h3>1970: ARPANET expands</h3>
              <p>
                By the end of 1970, ARPANET had grown to 13 nodes, including
                East Coast schools like Harvard and MIT. Among the early nodes
                was Bolt, Beranek, and Newman (BBN), an engineering consulting
                company that did the engineering work required to build ARPANET.
                Each ARPANET site had a router known as an Interface Message
                Processor. These cost $82,200, or half a million dollars in
                today's money.

              <h3>1973: ARPANET goes international</h3>
              <p>
                In 1973, the ARPANET became international, with a satellite link
                connecting Norway and London to the other nodes in the United
                States. Hawaii also joined the network by satellite. At this
                point, the network had around 40 nodes. New ARPANET applications
                had begun to emerge. Email was invented in 1971 by a BBN
                engineer named Ray Tomlinson, who also invented the use of the
                "@" symbol in email addresses. The File Transfer Protocol, which
                is still used today, allowed ARPANET users to send files to each
                other.

              <h3>B1982: the ARPANET community grows</h3>
              <p>
                As the ARPANET entered its second decade, it was still largely
                confined to the United States. Academic institutions depended on
                federal funding to join the network, so the number of nodes
                expanded slowly. By 1982, the network only had about 100 nodes.
                But that was enough to support a vibrant online community. Long
                before Facebook and Twitter, ARPANET allowed computer scientists
                who had access to the network to stay in touch. A new bulletin
                board system called Usenet was invented in 1980 and caught on
                quickly. Usenet was organized by topic, allowing users to swap
                programming tips, recipes, jokes, opinions about science
                fiction, and much more.

              <h3>1984: ARPANET becomes the internet</h3>
              <p>
                Originally, the entire ARPANET was managed by the military. But
                network operators realized that a centralized network would
                eventually become unmanageable if it continued to grow. They
                decided that the network should be reorganized as a
                decentralized "network of networks." Under this scheme,
                different networks would be controlled by different
                organizations, but all the networks able to communicate using
                shared standards, forming a shared "internet." The military
                asked the computer scientists Robert Kahn and Vint Cerf to
                develop new networking standards to make this possible. The
                result was a set of standards known as TCP/IP. These standards
                specified the basic format of data packets transmitted across
                the internet. On January 1, 1983, the ARPANET switched to using
                TCP/IP, marking the birth of the modern internet. The switch to
                TCP/IP didn't make much difference from a user perspective —
                applications like email and Telnet worked about the same as they
                had before. But the new standard paved the way for much faster
                network growth by lowering the barrier to entry for new
                networks. One of the first new networks to connect to the new
                internet was CSNET, which was funded by the National Science
                Foundation to link computer science departments across the
                country. This map shows the location of ARPANET and CSNET nodes
                (labeled "Phonenet"), which after 1983 communicated with each
                other using TCP/IP. By the time the ARPANET was decommissioned
                in 1990, it was just one of many networks that comprised the
                internet. Today, the internet is made up of more than 40,000
                different networks. These networks still communicate with each
                other using the TCP/IP standards Cerf and Kahn developed in the
                1970s.
